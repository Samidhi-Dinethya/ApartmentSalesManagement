2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute mssql_database_setup.sql in SQL Server Management Studio
   ```
3. **Switch configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Run the batch file
   switch-to-mssql.bat
   ```
4. **Update credentials** in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://your_server:1433;databaseName=apartment_sales_db;encrypt=true;trustServerCertificate=true
   ```
5. **Restart application**
